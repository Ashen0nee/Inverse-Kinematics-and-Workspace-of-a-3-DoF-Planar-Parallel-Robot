These are the MATLAB codes for the inverse kinematics and workspace of a 3 DoF planar parallel robot, including:

- IK.m: to calculate the inverse kinematics and plot the position and orientation of the platform for a given position and a rotation angle,
- Workspace.m: to plot the workspace of the centroid of the platform for a given rotation angle.
